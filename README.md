- This project is a 2D infinite runner game developed using p5.js, where the player controls a kangaroo running through the jungle. The goal is to collect shrubs to increase the score while avoiding obstacles like stones. The kangaroo can jump to dodge obstacles, and the game features smooth scrolling, animated sprites, and sound effects for actions like jumping, collecting, and colliding. The game continues indefinitely until the kangaroo collides with an obstacle, triggering a game over state. Players can restart the game at any time. Randomized object spawning and increasing difficulty over time keep the gameplay engaging and challenging.
- This project demonstrates key game development concepts including:
  - Sprite animation and collision detection
  - Camera-based infinite scrolling
  - Dynamic object spawning and game state management
  - Sound integration for enhanced user experience
